\subsection{Feature selection}
Before training a linear regression model, we first checked the relevance of each feature. The following output from a simple R-script shows the correlation coefficient of all available features.
\begin{verbatim}
> cor(features,prices$SMPEP,use='complete.obs')
prices.HolidayFlag            -0.001837929
prices.WeekOfYear             -0.015813567
prices.DayOfWeek              -0.069624872
prices.PeriodOfDay             0.323490486
prices.ForecastWindProduction -0.079638880
prices.SystemLoadEA            0.491096357
prices.SMPEA                   0.618158287
prices.ORKTemperature         -0.009086615
prices.ORKWindspeed           -0.035435662
prices.CO2Intensity           -0.035055080
\end{verbatim}
We can see that there are only 3 relevant features for predicting prices: \verb|SystemLoadEA|, \verb|SMPEA| and \verb|PeriodOfDay|. The relation between the first two features and the actual price of electricity is obvious. The relation between \verb|PeriodOfDay| and the actual price is less obvious however. We investigated this further and plotted the average price for each period of the day (Figure \ref{fig:timeslot_average}).

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{img/timeslot_averageprice.pdf}
	\caption{The average price during the day, measured per half hour.}
	\label{fig:timeslot_average}
\end{figure}

We can see a clear peak of price of energy at 18h00. This makes sense intuivitely. The energy consumption of consumers is the highest at that time and the energy market follows the simple principles of supply and demand. To make the relation between \verb|PeriodOfDay| and the actual price more linear, we transform it to a new feature \verb|PeriodsToPeak|. This new feature is the number of periods between the current period and the peak at 18h00. At 10h00 in the morning for example, the \verb|PeriodsToPeak| value is 16. This new feature achieves a better correlation with the actual price than just the raw period of the day.
\begin{verbatim}
prices.PeriodsToPeak          -0.413861750
\end{verbatim}
In conclusion, our linear regression model uses the following three features: \verb|SystemLoadEA|, \verb|SMPEA| and \verb|PeriodstoPeak|.

\subsection{Learning approach}
To estimate prices, we perform linear regression on the selected features discussed above. As such, the parameters of our estimation consist of a set of weights and an intercept. This intercept can be seen as just another weight that gets multiplied with a constant input of $1$. 

\subsection{Integration}

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/feedback.pdf}
	\caption{Difference between the default approach (top) and our integrated approach (bottom).}
	\label{fig:feedback}
\end{figure}

We have integrated the learning and scheduling phase by iteratively adapting the regression parameters to produce a more cost-efficient schedule. This is different from the standard approach, where the regression parameters are chosen to estimate the actual prices as closely as possible. A schematic overview of this can be seen in figure \ref{fig:feedback}. However, a better price estimate may not necessarily result in a better schedule\cite{ifrim2012properties}.

Since the actual energy prices for each day are not known at the time of scheduling, we cannot use them to evaluate generated schedules to select the best one. To overcome this problem, we introduce an assumption: the features values and actual prices of the day before the current day are representative for the current day with respect to the scheduling. We then pose the question: "what would yesterday have been the best possible model for the load of today". We answer this question by searching locally for weights that result in a schedule which minimizes the total cost. To perform this search, we use a hill climber. The hill climber is initialized with weights learned from performing ordinary least-squares on a set of history days (by default 30). During each iteration, the weights are modified and a new schedule is generated using MiniZinc. Note that while the constraint problem solved corresponds to the load \emph{of the current day}, the feature values \emph{of the day before} are used as input to the regression. This resulting schedule is then evaluated with the actual price of the day before.
