\subsection{Feature selection}
Before training a linear regression model, we first checked the relevance of each feature. The following output from a simple R-script shows the correlation coefficient of all available features.
\begin{verbatim}
> cor(features,prices$SMPEP,use='complete.obs')
prices.HolidayFlag            -0.001837929
prices.WeekOfYear             -0.015813567
prices.DayOfWeek              -0.069624872
prices.PeriodOfDay             0.323490486
prices.ForecastWindProduction -0.079638880
prices.SystemLoadEA            0.491096357
prices.SMPEA                   0.618158287
prices.ORKTemperature         -0.009086615
prices.ORKWindspeed           -0.035435662
prices.CO2Intensity           -0.035055080
\end{verbatim}
We can see that there are only 3 relevant features for predicting prices: \verb|SystemLoadEA|, \verb|SMPEA| and \verb|PeriodOfDay|. The relation between the first two features and the actual price of electricity is obvious. The relation between \verb|PeriodOfDay| and the actual price is less obvious however. We investigated this further and plotted the average price for each period of the day (Figure \ref{fig:timeslot_average}).

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{img/timeslot_averageprice.pdf}
	\caption{The average price during the day, measured per half hour.}
	\label{fig:timeslot_average}
\end{figure}

We can see a clear peak of price of energy at 18h00. This makes sense intuivitely. The energy consumption of consumers is the highest at that time and the energy market follows the simple principles of supply and demand. To make the relation between \verb|PeriodOfDay| and the actual price more linear, we transform it to a new feature \verb|PeriodsToPeak|. This new feature is the number of periods between the current period and the peak at 18h00. At 10h00 in the morning for example, the \verb|PeriodsToPeak| value is 16. This new feature achieves a better correlation with the actual price than just the raw period of the day.
\begin{verbatim}
prices.PeriodsToPeak          -0.413861750
\end{verbatim}
In conclusion, our linear regression model uses the following three features: \verb|SystemLoadEA|, \verb|SMPEA| and \verb|PeriodstoPeak|.

\subsection{Learning approach}
To estimate prices, we perform linear regression on the selected features discussed above. As such, the parameters of our estimation consist of a set of weights and an intercept. This intercept can be seen as just another weight that gets multiplied with a constant input of $1$. 

\subsection{Integration}
The learning regression serves as an initialization for our integration method, which iteratively tries to adapt the regression parameters to produce a more cost-efficient schedule. Since the actual energy prices for each day are not known at the time of scheduling, we cannot use them to evaluate generated schedules to select the best one.

To overcome this problem, we introduce an assumption: the features values and actual prices of the day before the current day are representative for the current day with respect to the scheduling. We then pose the question: "what would yesterday have been the best possible model for the load of today". We answer this question by searching locally for a set of weights that result in a schedule that minimizes the total cost.
